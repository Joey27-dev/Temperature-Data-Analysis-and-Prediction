Temperature Data Analysis and Prediction

Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing a large dataset of temperature readings (indoor and outdoor) collected across ~97,000 records.
The aim was to perform data analysis, build machine learning models, and conduct future predictions based on the observed trends.

Data Description
Temp_ID: Unique identifier for each reading.
Indoor Temperature: Indoor temperature measurement (in °C).
Outdoor Temperature: Outdoor temperature measurement (in °C).

The dataset contains approximately 97,000 records, providing a rich base for analysis and modeling.

Key Activities
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on temperature trends.
- Train-test split for model development.
- Building predictive models for temperature forecasting.
- Visualizations for trends and model performance.

Technologies Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries: Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-Learn (sklearn)

Results
The project successfully demonstrated basic machine learning applications, including training models to predict temperature trends and analyzing the relationship between indoor and outdoor temperatures. Using the libraries I was also able to do suffecient data manipulation and visualisation. 

How to Run
- Open the .ipynb notebook in JupyterLab / Jupyter Notebook which can be opened via your terminal.
- Ensure you have installed the required Python libraries (pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn).
